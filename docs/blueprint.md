## Style Guidelines:

- The primary color palette is built for a professional and sleek aesthetic, optimized for dark mode. Primary: A modern Electric Blue (#2E7DED). Background: Deep Charcoal (#121212). Accent: A complementary Teal Green (#2EDAEB). The application also supports a light mode with Soft Grey/White backgrounds and Navy Blue/Slate accents.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, professional, and highly legible appearance across all text. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Icons will be sourced from Lucide-React, chosen for their clean lines and versatility to maintain a minimalist visual style.
- The layout features a two-column Hero Section, a 3-column grid for services, categorized chips for skills, a vertical timeline for experience/education, and responsive cards for projects, all designed to be fully mobile-friendly.
- Utilize Framer Motion to implement elegant scroll-reveal animations, creating an 'anti-gravity feel' that adds a high-end, dynamic touch to the user experience as content becomes visible.
